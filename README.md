# Live Page > [Google Homepage Clone]https://charliebarger.github.io/google-homepage/

This is a google homepage clone that i created as part of The Odin Projects Curriculum. The project is made with pure HTML & CSS and uses flexbox for the layout of the site. This mock site aims to mimic the look of the google homepage without adding functionality.
